# Intro

This repository is an example of writing a library in _Swift_ including testing.

The code solves the [first day of advent of code 2015](http://adventofcode.com/2015/day/1).

Uses [Quick](https://github.com/Quick/Quick) and [Nimble](https://github.com/Quick/Nimble) to write tests and assertions.

## How to run it?

`swift test`

# Guidelines (Extremely important things to consider)

* Tests should be included (preferable using Quick & Nimble)
* Code should be very clear
* It should run with `swift test` from the command line
* Functional style is encouraged
* Super extra bonus points for using [SwiftCheck](https://github.com/typelift/SwiftCheck)
